# --- Workflow Engine Settings ---
# Choose one of the following:

## Option 1: Run workflows directly with Docker
DOCKER_ENGINE_URL=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
#DOCKER_CERT_PATH_HOST=/my/home/dir/.docker/machine/certs # Uncomment if connecting to a remote Docker engine over network

## Option 2: Use a Workflow Execution Service (WES)
#WES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8082/ga4gh/wes/v1
#WES_SHARED_DIR_PROPERTY=


# --- General Orchestrator Settings (required) ---

## Synapse credentials for account with "Admin" access to the Synapse Project and Evaluation Queue(s)
SYNAPSE_USERNAME=
SYNAPSE_PAT=

## Folder synID where workflow log files and results will be stored
WORKFLOW_OUTPUT_ROOT_ENTITY_ID=

## JSON map of evaluationIDs to their associated workflow template synIDs
## Example: {"9614045": "syn123", "9614046": "syn456"}
EVALUATION_TEMPLATES={}

## Controls resource limits and retry behavior for TOIL jobs (recommended for Docker-based workflows).

## If 'false', a separate process is needed to "unlock" files. Default is 'true'.
#SHARE_RESULTS_IMMEDIATELY=

## Only required if SHARE_RESULTS_IMMEDIATELY is set to 'false'.
#DATA_UNLOCK_SYNAPSE_PRINCIPAL_ID=

## Docker image for the workflow engine when using Docker-based workflows.
## Default is sagebionetworks/synapse-workflow-orchestrator-toil:1.0.
#WORKFLOW_ENGINE_DOCKER_IMAGE=

## Maximum number of workflows allowed to run concurrently. Default is 10.
#MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS=

## Set to 'true' if the containerized workflow needs to run in privileged mode.
