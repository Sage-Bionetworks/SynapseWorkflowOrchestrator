**Synapse Workflow Orchestrator Build**

![Docker Automated](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/automated/sagebionetworks/synapse-workflow-orchestrator.svg) ![Docker Build](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/sagebionetworks/synapse-workflow-orchestrator.svg)

# Synapse Workflow Orchestrator
Links one or more Synapse Evaluation queues to a workflow engine. Each Evaluation queue is associated with a workflow template. Each submission is a workflow job, an instance of the workflow template. Upon submission to the Evaluation queue the Workflow Orchestrator initiates and tracks the workflow job, sending progress notifications and uploading log files.


## Features:
- Services one or more Synapse submission queues.
- Enforces time quota (signaled by separate process).
- Reconciles running submissions listed in Synapse with those listed by the workflow engine. Notifies admin' if there is a workflow job without a running submission listed in Synapse.
- Respects keyboard interrupt and ensures Workflow Orchestrator stops at the end of a monitoring cycle.
- Implements submission cancellation.
- Tracks in Synapse when the job was started and ended (last updated).
- Notifies submitter about invalid submissions, notifies queue administrator about problems with the queue itself.
- Uploads logs to Synapse periodically and when done.
- Populates a status dashboard in Synapse with the following fields:
    - job status
    - start timestamp
    - last updated timestamp
    - location where log file is uploaded
    - failure reason (if workflow job failed to complete)
    - progress (0->100%), if provided by the Workflow engine

## Setting up Amazon linux environment

1. Install docker `sudo yum install docker`
1. Must start the docker service: `sudo service docker start` or you will get this error: `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`
1. Allow for non-root user to manage docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
1. Log out and back into the instance to be able to do `docker images` as current user
1. Install docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose.

## To use:

### Create a project, submission queue, workflow template and dashboard
To run:

```
docker run --rm -it -e SYNAPSE_USERNAME=xxxxx -e SYNAPSE_PAT=xxxxx \
-e WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE_URL=http://xxxxxx -e ROOT_TEMPLATE=xxxxx ghcr.io/sage-bionetworks/synapseworkfloworchestrator /set_up.sh
```

where `WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE_URL` is a link to a zip file and `ROOT_TEMPLATE` is a path within the zip where a workflow file can be found. To use a workflow in Dockstore:

```
docker run --rm -it -e SYNAPSE_USERNAME=xxxxx -e SYNAPSE_PAT=xxxxx \
-e WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE_URL=https://dockstore.org:8443/api/ga4gh/v2/tools/{id}/versions/{version_id}/CWL \
-e ROOT_TEMPLATE=xxxxx ghcr.io/sage-bionetworks/synapseworkfloworchestrator /set_up.sh
```

Will print out created Project ID and the value for the `EVALUATION_TEMPLATES` in the following step.

### Linking your workflow with evaluation queue manually

If you already have an existing project and do not want to follow the `Create a project, submission queue, workflow template and dashboard` instructions above, here are instructions on how to link your workflow with an Evaluation queue.

1. Create an Evaluation queue in a Synapse Project and retrieve the Evaluation id. View instructions [here](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/evaluation_queues.html) to learn more. For this example, lets say the Evaluation id is `1234`.
1. Obtain the link of your github repo as a zipped file. (eg. https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SynapseWorkflowExample/archive/master.zip)
1. Upload this URL into your project and set the annotation ROOT_TEMPLATE to be the path of your workflow. So for the example, the value would be `SynapseWorkflowExample-master/workflow-entrypoint.cwl`. For this example, lets say the Synapse id of this File is `syn2345`
1. `EVALUATION_TEMPLATES` will be: {"1234":"syn2345"}


### Start the workflow service

There are three ways to start the workflow service:
1. Orchestrator with Docker containers
1. Orchestrator with Workflow Execution Service (W.E.S.)
1. Orchestrator with a Java executable `.jar` file + Docker

#### Running the Orchestrator with Docker containers
This method is convenient if your environment supports Docker and you are authorized to run Docker containers in it. Set the following as properties in a .env file to use with Docker Compose. Please carefully read through these properties and fill out the .envTemplate, but make sure you rename the template to .env.

* `DOCKER_ENGINE_URL` - address of the Docker engine. Along with `DOCKER_CERT_PATH_HOST` this is needed since the Workflow Orchestrator will manage containers. Examples:

    ```
    DOCKER_ENGINE_URL=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    ```
    or
    ```
    DOCKER_ENGINE_URL=tcp://192.168.0.1:2376
    ```

* `DOCKER_CERT_PATH_HOST` - (optional) path to credentials files allowing networked access to Docker engine. Required if connecting over the network (`DOCKER_ENGINE_URL` starts with `http`, `https` or `tcp`, but not with `unix`). Example:

    ```
    DOCKER_CERT_PATH_HOST=/my/home/dir/.docker/machine/certs
    ```

    When using `DOCKER_CERT_PATH_HOST` you must also add the following under `volumes:` in `docker-compose.yaml`:

    ```
    - ${DOCKER_CERT_PATH_HOST}:/certs:ro
    ```

* `WES_ENDPOINT` - omit this parameter
* `WES_SHARED_DIR_PROPERTY` - omit this parameter
* `SYNAPSE_USERNAME` - Synapse credentials under which the Workflow Orchestrator will run. Must have access to evaluation queue(s) being serviced
* `SYNAPSE_PAT` - personal access token (PAT) for `SYNAPSE_USERNAME`
* `WORKFLOW_OUTPUT_ROOT_ENTITY_ID` - root (Project or Folder) for uploaded doc's, like log files. Hierarchy is root/submitterId/submissionId/files. May be the ID of the project generated in the set-up step, above.
* `EVALUATION_TEMPLATES` - JSON mapping evaluation ID(s) to URL(s) for workflow template archive. Returned by the set up step, above. Example:

    ```
    {"9614045":"syn16799953"}
    ```

* `TOIL_CLI_OPTIONS` - (optional, but highly recommended) Used when `DOCKER_ENGINE_URL` is selected. Space separated list of options. (Without the toil parameters, you may run into errors when a new workflow job is started). See https://toil.readthedocs.io/en/3.15.0/running/cliOptions.html. Example:

    ```
    TOIL_CLI_OPTIONS=--defaultMemory 100M --retryCount 0 --defaultDisk 1000000
    ```
* `NOTIFICATION_PRINCIPAL_ID` - (optional) Synapse ID of user or team to be notified of system issues. If omitted then notification are sent to the Synapse account under which the workflow pipeline is run.
* `SUBMITTER_NOTIFICATION_MASK` - controls for which events notifications are sent to the submitter. The integer value is a union of these masks:
    ```
    1: send message when job has started;
    2: send message when job has completed;
    4: send message when job has failed;
    8: send message when job has been stopped by user;
    16: send message when job has timed out;
    ```
    Default is 31, i.e. send notifications for every event.
* `SHARE_RESULTS_IMMEDIATELY` - (optional) if omitted or set to 'true', uploaded results are immediately accessible by submitter. If false then a separate process must 'unlock' files. This is useful when workflows run on sensitive data and administration needs to control the volume of results returned to the workflow submitter.
* `DATA_UNLOCK_SYNAPSE_PRINCIPAL_ID` - (optional) Synapse ID of user authorized to share (unlock) workflow output files (only required if `SHARE_RESULTS_IMMEDIATELY` is false).
* `WORKFLOW_ENGINE_DOCKER_IMAGE` - (optional) Used when `DOCKER_ENGINE_URL` is selected. Defaults to sagebionetworks/synapse-workflow-orchestrator-toil:1.0 , produced from [this Dockerfile](Dockerfile.Toil). When overriding the default, you must ensure that the existing dependencies are preserved. One way to do this is to start your own Dockerfile with
    ```
    FROM sagebionetworks/synapse-workflow-orchestrator-toil
    ```
    and then to add additional dependencies.
* `MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS` - (optional) the maximum number of workflows that will be allowed to run at any time. Default is 10.
* `RUN_WORKFLOW_CONTAINER_IN_PRIVILEGED_MODE` - (optional) Used when `DOCKER_ENGINE_URL` is selected. If `true` then when the containerized workflow is initiated, the container it's running in will be run in 'privileged mode'. In some environments this is required for workflows which themselves run containers.
* `ACCEPT_NEW_SUBMISSIONS` - (optional) if omitted then new submissions will be started. If present, then should be boolean (`true` or `false`). If `false` then no new submissions will be started, only existing ones will be finished up. This is an important feature for smoothly decommissioning one machine to switch to another.

To start the service use:

```
docker-compose --verbose up
```

#### Running the Orchestrator with Workflow Execution Service

Do you wish to run the workflow jobs themselves as Docker containers or by sending jobs as web requests to a Workflow Execution Service (W.E.S.)? This lets you leverage the features of a chosen W.E.S. implementation. The instructions in the previous sections should be modified as follows:

* `WES_ENDPOINT` - The address prefix of the WES Server, e.g., https://weshost.com/ga4gh/wes/v1.
* `WES_SHARED_DIR_PROPERTY` - The location of a folder accessible by both the Orchestrator and the WES server.  This is where the Synapse credentials file will be written.  Note, this means that the server and the Orchestrator must share a file system.
* `DOCKER_ENGINE_URL` - omit this parameter
* `DOCKER_CERT_PATH_HOST` - omit this parameter
* `TOIL_CLI_OPTIONS` - omit this parameter
* `WORKFLOW_ENGINE_DOCKER_IMAGE` - omit this parameter
* `RUN_WORKFLOW_CONTAINER_IN_PRIVILEGED_MODE` - omit this parameter

To start the service use:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-wes.yaml --verbose up
```

#### Running the Orchestrator as an Executable .jar file
Sometimes you are forced to be on infrastructure that doesn't allow Docker.  To support this we have also provided the Orchestrator in the form of an executable .jar file.  You can find the setup instructions below.   You can download the jar files [here](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SynapseWorkflowOrchestrator/releases)

Running the container as an executable .jar file still allows you the choice of running the workflow jobs themselves as Docker containers or as submissions to a Workflow Excecution Service (W.E.S.)  The example below includes environment settings for the latter.  Please refer to the setting instructions above to see the full range of options.

```
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
# Use screen to allow for continous running
screen -S orchestrator
# Export all the values you use in your .env file
# these values are explained above
export WES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8082/ga4gh/wes/v1
export WES_SHARED_DIR_PROPERTY=/path/to/something
export SYNAPSE_USERNAME=xxxxxx
export SYNAPSE_PAT=xxxxxx
export WORKFLOW_OUTPUT_ROOT_ENTITY_ID=syn3333
# Remember to put quotes around the EVALUATION_TEMPLATES
export EVALUATION_TEMPLATES='{"111": "syn111"}'
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=workflow_orchestrator
# export MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS=
```

To start the service use:
```
java -jar  WorkflowOrchestrator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

### Submit a job to the queue

Jobs can be submitted using the Synapse web portal.  Below is a command-line convenience for submitting using a Dockerized tool.

```
docker run --rm -it -e SYNAPSE_USERNAME=xxxxx -e SYNAPSE_PAT=xxxxx -e EVALUATION_ID=xxxxx \
-v /path/to/workflow/job:/workflowjob sagebionetworks/synapse-workflow-orchestrator:1.0  /submit.sh
```
where `EVALUATION_ID` is one of the keys in the `EVALUATION_TEMPLATES` map returned from the set-up step

## See results

In the Synapse web browser, visit the Project created in the first step. You will see a dashboard of submissions.


### Tear down
Stop the service:

```
docker-compose down
```
Now, in Synapse, simply delete the root level project


## Workflow creation guidelines

See [this example](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SynapseWorkflowExample) for a working example of a Synapse-linked workflow. It includes reusable steps for downloading submissions and files, uploading files and annotating submissions. Some notes:


* The workflow inputs are non-negotiable and must be as shown in the [sample workflow entry point](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SynapseWorkflowExample/blob/master/workflow-entrypoint.cwl).
* If the submission is a .cwl input file then it can be download by [this script](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SynapseWorkflowExample/blob/master/downloadSubmissionFile.cwl) and parsed by a step customized from [this example](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SynapseWorkflowExample/blob/master/job_file_reader_tool_yaml_sample.cwl).
* The workflow should not change the 'status' field of the submission status, which is reserved for the use of the Workflow Orchestrator.
* The workflow must have no output. Any results should be written to Synapse along the way, e.g., as shown in in [this example](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/SynapseWorkflowExample/blob/master/uploadToSynapse.cwl).

## Other details

### Uploading results

The workflow orchestrator uses this folder hierarchy for uploading results:

```
< WORKFLOW_OUTPUT_ROOT_ENTITY_ID> / <SUBMITTER_ID> / <SUBMISSION_ID> /
```
and

```
< WORKFLOW_OUTPUT_ROOT_ENTITY_ID> / <SUBMITTER_ID>_LOCKED / <SUBMISSION_ID> /
```
where

* `<WORKFLOW_OUTPUT_ROOT_ENTITY_ID>` is a parameter passed to the orchestrator at startup;
* `<SUBMITTER_ID>` is the user or team responsible for the submission;
* `<SUBMISSION_ID>` is the ID of the submission;

When `SHARE_RESULTS_IMMEDIATELY` is omitted or set to `true` then logs are uploaded into the unlocked folder. When  `SHARE_RESULTS_IMMEDIATELY` is set to `false` then logs are uploaded into the locked folder. To share the log file (or anything else uploaded to the `_LOCKED` folder) with the submitter, a process separate from the workflow should *move* the item(s) to the unlocked folder, rather than by creating an ACL on the lowest level folder. Such a process can run under a separate Synapse account, if desired. If so, set `DATA_UNLOCK_SYNAPSE_PRINCIPAL_ID` to be the Synapse principal ID of the account used to run that process.

The workflow is passed the IDs of both the locked and unlocked submission folders so it can choose whether the submitter can see the results it uploads by choosing which folder to upload to.

### Timing out

The workflow orchestrator checks each submission for an integer (long) annotation named `orgSagebionetworksSynapseWorkflowOrchestratorTimeRemaining`. If the value is present and not greater than zero then the submission will be stopped and a "timed out" notification sent. If the annotation is not present then no action will be taken. Through this mechanism a custom application can determine which submissions have exceeded their alloted time and stop them. Such an application is communicating with the workflow orchestrator via the submissions' annotations. This architecture allows each submission queue administrator to customize the time-out logic rather than having some particular algorithm hard-coded into the workflow orchestrator.


### Decommissioning a Machine
If there is a need to decommission a machine while workflows are pending, then do the following:

Stop the service, e.g., if you started via Docker:

```
docker-compose down
```
Set the environment variable, `ACCEPT_NEW_SUBMISSIONS` to `false`. Now restart, if you started via Docker:

```
docker-compose up
```
or, if using Docker with W.E.S.:

```
docker-compose up -f docker-compose-wes.yaml
```

The currently running submissions will finish up but no new jobs will be started. When all running jobs have finished,

```
docker-compose down
```
The machine may now be decommissioned.
